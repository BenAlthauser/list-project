  <h1>essential peripherals</h1>
  <h2>chapter goals</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Explain how to support multipurpose connectors</li>
    <li>Identify and install standard peripherals (that aren’t display devices) on a PC</li>
    <li>Identify and install standard storage devices (that aren’t SSDs or HDDs) and their media</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>notes</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Each standard defines more than just the speed. Because they were incorporated into the newer standard, many Low-Speed and Full-Speed USB devices <br> are also USB 2.0 devices.</li>
    <li>In general, your connection will operate at the speed of the slowest device involved. If you have a USB 2.0 device connected to a USB 3.x port on your<br> PC, it will operate at USB 2.0 speeds.</li>
    <li>There are exceptions to the “install the driver first” rule. USB thumb drives, for example, don’t need extra drivers at all. Just plug them in and every<br> modern OS will pick them up. (Technically speaking, though, that means the drivers came preinstalled
      with the operating system!)</li>

  </ol>

  <h1>exam tips</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) does not officially use “Low-Speed” and “Full-Speed” to describe 1.5-Mbps and 12-Mbps devices, calling both of them simply <br>“USB 1.1.” On the CompTIA A+ certification exams, though, you’ll see the marketplace-standard
      nomenclature used here. For the 220-901 exam, focus on USB 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0.</li>
    <li>On USB 1.1 and 2.0 cables, the A and B ports and connectors use four pins, while the rest use five pins. USB 3.0/3.1 A and B ports and connectors use nine pins.<br> A larger, 11-pin USB 3.0/3.1 B connector that can supply extra power to a device also
      exists.</li>
    <li>USB Type-C connectors don’t show up in the exam objectives as of this writing, but the “universal” connector for USB is rolling out quickly now. The running joke <br>about USB is that every connector has three sides: Up position; Down position; and
      the third time you try to plug it in and it works, the Superposition. USB Type-C just plugs in either way.</li>
